## #ByeNewspaper是什么

- **源起**<br>
  Theme settings are presented as a flat list of logically-named [CSS custom properties](customization). There's no need to navigate or modify complex CSS, allowing changes to be made quickly and confidently.

- **有什么**<br>
  All processing is done in the browser, removing the need for CSS preprocessors and other build tools. Just link to a theme, then customize by setting [theme-related properties](customization). That's it.

- **想为报纸留一份底稿**<br>
  Use a theme as-is, or as a starting point for something completely new. All themes share the same customizable properties, making it easy mix styles from different themes.

- **我们是谁**<br>
  Enhancements that are unique to docsify-themeable—along with docsify- and browser-related bug fixes—provide a more enjoyable and trouble-free experience for site authors and visitors.
